# Features

Full feature catalog for Rusty Requester. For a quick pitch see the
[main README](../readme.md); for internal design see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Core

- 🚀 **Truly native** — Rust + `egui`, no Electron, no Chromium
- 💾 **Fully offline** — all data lives in one local JSON file, no cloud sync, no telemetry
- 🎨 **Dark / Light / Postman themes** — rust-orange / amber accents on either a deep Monokai-style dark canvas *(v0.1)* or a GitHub-ish near-white canvas *(v0.14)*; plus a **Postman** theme (pure-white canvas, warm-gray sidebar chrome, Postman-blue accent, Inter-Light UI font) *(v0.18)*. Toggle in Settings, preview immediately, and persist only when Save is pressed. Syntax-highlighted response body adapts: Monokai on dark, dark-on-paper on the paper themes.
- 🍎 Builds for Apple Silicon, Intel Mac, Linux, and Windows
- 🪟 **Native macOS title-bar integration** — traffic-light buttons float over the app content (no dark stub strip above the workspace).

## Request building

- 🔧 Full HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`
- 📝 Tabbed editor: **Params · Headers · Cookies · Body · Auth · Tests**
- 🔗 **Bidirectional URL ↔ Params sync** (Postman-style): type `?foo=bar` in the URL bar → params populate the table; edit the table → URL bar rebuilds. Auto-growing "ghost" row.
- 🍪 Cookies list (merged into a `Cookie` header on send)
- 🔐 Auth presets: **No Auth · Bearer Token · Basic Auth · OAuth 2.0** + **JWT decoder** (Bearer tokens auto-decode below the input — header & payload pretty JSON, scope/exp at a glance)
- 🪪 **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE** *(v0.15)* — click **Get New Token** in the Auth tab; browser opens the provider's authorize URL, loopback listener catches the redirect, code is exchanged for a token via the provider's `token_url`. Access token auto-injected as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every send. Live status badge (valid / expired / refreshing soon). No client secret required for PKCE clients.
- 📦 **Body modes**: Raw / `x-www-form-urlencoded` / `multipart/form-data` / **GraphQL** (query + variables, sent as `application/json`)
- 📐 **Line-numbered request body** with subtle `Beautify` / `Minify` action links
- 🌱 **Environment variables** — define key/value vars per environment, reference them anywhere with `{{varname}}`. Switch active env from the sidebar.
- 📜 **Request history** — every send is logged (method, URL, status, time, response preview); browse the last 200 from the sidebar's History tab.
- 🔗 **Post-response extractors (Tests tab)** *(v0.4)* — dot/bracket paths (`data.token`, `items[0].id`, `$.x`) or header names that pull a value from the response and write it into the active environment, so the next request can `{{token}}` it.
- ✅ **Assertions (Tests tab)** *(v0.4)* — pass/fail rules against the response: status equals/`>`/`<`, header exists, body-path equals / contains / matches `^2..$`. Result-dot per row (green / red / amber); toast summarizes after each send.

## Responses

- 📊 Status pill + response time + size rendered inline with the Body/Headers tab row, on the right (Postman-style: `Body  Headers  JSON Tree Raw  [🔍][📋][💾]    200 OK · 54 ms · 434 B`)
- 🛈 **Size hover tooltip** — breakdown of response headers/body and request headers/body bytes
- 🛈 **Time hover tooltip** — gantt-style phase breakdown: Prepare · Waiting (TTFB) · Download
- 🧩 **Body view modes**: **JSON** (syntax-highlighted code editor with line numbers + Postman-style fold chevrons next to every multi-line `{` / `[` — *(v0.18.4)*), **Tree** (collapsible JSON tree with filter + right-click "Copy path"), **Preview** (HTML rendered as readable text for error pages / login challenges), **Events** (structured log for `text/event-stream` / SSE responses), **Diff** (unified +/− against the previous response), **Raw** (verbatim) — pills are inline with the section tabs and don't scroll away
- 🪗 **JSON folding** *(v0.18.4)* — click the chevron next to any `{` or `[` to collapse it into a `{ …}` / `[ …]` placeholder; click again to expand. Selection / copy / ⌘F search keep working over the visible (un-folded) text. Fold state is per-response and resets on every Send.
- 🧠 **Per-request response cache** *(v0.15.6)* — switching tabs preserves each request's last response (body, status, timings, headers, SSE events, assertion results). Session-only; closed tabs drop their cache.
- 📡 **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** *(v0.10)* — native streaming support for LLM / event-stream APIs. Auto-detected by `Content-Type: text/event-stream`; events flow into a collapsible-per-row Events view with auto-scroll, per-event timestamps, and JSON-pretty-printed data. Cancel aborts the stream instantly.
- 🔀 **Response diff** *(v0.11)* — send a request twice to compare. The **Diff** pill shows a unified `+/-` line-diff of the current response against the previous one, with `+A −B` summary.
- 🛑 **Cancel button** *(v0.7)* — Send flips to Cancel while a request is in flight. Instantly aborts the tokio task + underlying hyper connection (no per-chunk polling).
- 🖼 **Failed/cancelled state** — dedicated illustrated screen with status headline + error-detail pill instead of opaque text, for network failures, TLS issues, or user cancels.
- 🔍 **Find in body** — toolbar search icon highlights all matches inline
- 📋 **Copy response body** + 💾 **Save response to file** (Content-Type → file extension auto-suggested)
- 📑 Separate **Body / Headers** tabs; rust-orange accent on header keys
- ⏳ Rust-orange **loading spinner** while the request is in flight
- 🎨 Auto-pretty-printed JSON responses; click into the view to position caret, select, ⌘A / ⌘C

## Cookie jar (per-environment)

*(v0.5)*

- 🪪 **`Set-Cookie` auto-persisted** into the active environment with name/domain/path/expiry tracked
- 🔄 **Auto-replayed** on the next request that matches host (suffix-match) + path (prefix-match) — same model browsers use
- ⏰ Expired cookies (Max-Age / Expires past) pruned automatically; session cookies kept until app quit
- 🔁 Switching active environment swaps the cookie set (Staging cookies don't leak into Prod)

## cURL interop

- 📋 **Copy as cURL** — current request → clipboard as a `curl` command
- 📥 **Paste from cURL** — paste any `curl` command and it becomes a request (method, URL, headers, body, auth, cookies, params — all parsed)
- 💻 **Code snippet panel** — side panel generating `cURL` / Python `requests` / JavaScript `fetch` / HTTPie, with syntax-highlighted code + line numbers and a copy icon

## Collections

- 📚 **Collections & subfolders** — organize requests in nested folders
- ➕ **Inline `+` button** on every folder header — adds a request in one click
- ⋯ **Overflow menu** on every folder header — Open overview · Add request · Add folder · Rename · Duplicate · Delete
- 📖 **Collection overview page** — click "Open overview" to see a dedicated homepage with title, recursive request/folder counts, an editable description, and a clickable request list
- 🪆 **Duplicate** folders recursively (keeps structure, fresh UUIDs) or individual requests
- 💾 **Save draft to any folder** — the save-draft modal shows a full folder tree with search + "New folder"
- 🔄 **Drag to reorder** requests within a folder (drag the row, drop on a new position)
- 🔎 **Search** across request names, URLs, methods, and folder names (⌘K to focus)
- 📤 **Export** all collections as **JSON** or **YAML**
- 📥 **Import** JSON, YAML, or **Postman Collection v2.1** files
- ✏️ Rename via double-click or right-click

## Collection Runner

- ▶️ **Scoped batch runs** — open **Collection Runner…** from the Actions Palette or Request menu, then run all collections or one selected collection/folder.
- 🧾 **CSV / JSON data rows** — paste a CSV table or JSON object/array. Each row becomes one full iteration and is overlaid as runner-scoped environment variables for existing `{{var}}` substitution.
- 🔁 **Chained workflows** — cookies and response extractors flow forward during the run, so login → fetch → assert sequences work without writing back into the saved environment.
- ✅ **Assertions per request** — existing Tests-tab assertions are evaluated during the run and summarized as pass / fail / error counts.
- 📈 **Live progress** — result rows appear as each request completes, with `X / Y` progress, HTTP status, timing, assertion counts, extractor counts, and misses.
- 📤 **CSV / HTML reports** — export the finished run for sharing or regression notes. Reports intentionally omit response bodies, response headers, cookies, extracted values, and full query strings.

## Tabs

- 📑 **Multi-tab workspace** — open many requests in parallel; tabs persist across quit/relaunch
- ⚓ **Pinned tabs** *(v0.9.1)* — right-click → **Pin tab** keeps a tab around; ⌘W and "Close all" skip pinned tabs (accent-colored pin glyph in the tab strip)
- 🧬 **Duplicate tab** *(v0.9.1)* — **⌘D** (or right-click → Duplicate tab) clones the current request as a new draft with `(copy)` appended to the name
- 💾 **"Save changes?" confirmation** *(v0.8)* — closing a draft tab with unsaved content opens a modal (Don't save · Cancel · Save changes)

## Workflow

- 🎛 **Settings modal** *(v0.3)* — request timeout, max body size cap (50 MB default; truncates with banner), proxy URL, TLS verification toggle. All persisted to disk.
- 🎨 **Theme preview before save** — Settings applies the selected theme immediately for preview, then commits or discards it with Save / Cancel.
- 🔌 **Reused HTTP client + tokio runtime** *(v0.3 / v0.5)* — no per-request connection-pool / runtime spinup; faster repeated sends.
- ⌨️ **⌘P command palette** *(v0.5)* — fuzzy-find any request across every collection, ↑↓ navigate, Enter to open
- ⌨️ **⇧⌘P actions palette** *(v0.11)* — fuzzy-find an app **action** (New request, Duplicate tab, Toggle snippet panel, Copy as cURL, Open environments, Clear history, …). Fully discoverable — open the palette and start typing.
- ⌨️ **↑ / ↓ arrow nav** — step through every request across every collection when nothing's focused; wraps at both ends
- ⌨️ Standard shortcuts: **⌘⏎** Send · **⌘N** New request · **⌘W** Close tab · **⌘D** Duplicate tab · **⌘K** Focus search · **⌘S** Save draft · **⌘P** Command palette · **⇧⌘P** Actions palette · **F2** Rename · **Esc** Dismiss modals
- 🍎 **Native macOS NSMenu bar** *(v0.3)* — (Rusty Requester · File · View · Request · Help) via `muda`; in-window menu on Linux
- 🎨 **Phosphor icon font** *(v0.9)* — 1,200+ tintable icons rendered as font glyphs; crisp at every DPI, zero image assets to ship
- ℹ **Help → About** opens a custom modal with creator credit + Contribute / Report-issue links
- 🔔 **Update check + sidebar pill** *(v0.13 / v0.16.1)* — on-launch GitHub-latest-release check (one silent GET, off-switch in Settings); sidebar pill when a newer tag lands, with a copyable install-one-liner modal. Dismissible per-version so deferring doesn't re-pester.

## Usage guide

### Your first request

1. Click **➕ New Collection** in the sidebar
2. Inside the collection, click **➕ Request** (or **➕ Folder** to nest further)
3. Pick a method, enter a URL, add headers / params / cookies / body / auth as needed
4. Click **Send** (or press **Enter** while in the URL field)

All edits auto-save to local disk as you type.

### Importing from cURL

**Just paste it into the URL bar.** When the field's text starts with `curl `,
the app parses the command and fills in method, URL, headers, params, cookies,
body, and auth automatically. A toast confirms the import.

Supported `curl` flags:

- `-X / --request` — method
- `-H / --header` — headers
- `-d / --data / --data-raw / --data-binary` — body (also implies `POST` if no `-X`)
- `-u / --user` — Basic auth
- `-b / --cookie` — cookies (split into the Cookies list)
- `-A`, `-e`, `--url`, `-G`, `-I`, and line-continuations (`\`)

There's also a **Sidebar → 📥 Import → Paste cURL command…** option for users
who'd rather use a dedicated dialog.

### Exporting as cURL / Python / JavaScript / HTTPie

Click **`</> Code`** next to Send. A **right-side code panel** opens with a
language picker (cURL · Python `requests` · JavaScript `fetch` · HTTPie). The
code respects which headers / params / cookies you've enabled. The displayed
snippet and main copy action redact authorization, cookie, sensitive query, and
sensitive body values for sharing; use **Copy raw** in the panel when you need
the original values.

### Importing / exporting collections

- **Sidebar → 📥 Import → Import collection file…** — pick a `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml` file. Postman Collection v2.1 files are auto-detected (schema sniffed) and land as one new collection. IDs are regenerated on import so nothing collides with your existing data.
- **Sidebar → 📤 Export → Export all as JSON / YAML…** — dumps every collection into a single file (good for backups).
- **Right-click any collection / folder → Export as JSON / YAML…** — exports just that subtree (this is the "collection-level" export for sharing).

### Running collections with data rows

Open **Collection Runner…** from **⇧⌘P / Ctrl+Shift+P** or the Request menu.
Select **All collections** or a specific folder/collection scope, paste optional
CSV or JSON data, then click **Run**. The results table updates live as each
request completes.

CSV data uses the first row as headers:

```csv
username,password
alice,secret
bob,secret2
```

JSON accepts either one object or an array of objects:

```json
[
  { "username": "alice", "password": "secret" },
  { "username": "bob", "password": "secret2" }
]
```

Each row is applied as runner-scoped environment variables for that iteration,
so a URL like `https://{{host}}/users/{{username}}` works without modifying the
saved environment. Extractors and cookies chain forward during the run, but
runner state is not written back to your environment. After completion, export
CSV or HTML reports from the runner modal.

### Environment variables

Use the **Env** dropdown at the top of the sidebar to switch between
environments (e.g. *Local*, *Staging*, *Prod*). Click the **⚙** button next to
it to open the **Environments** manager: add an environment, rename it, and
fill in key/value pairs. Then reference any variable as `{{name}}` anywhere in
your URL, query params, headers, cookies, body, or auth — substitution happens
at send time.

Example: set `host = api.staging.com` and `token = abc123`, then a request URL
of `https://{{host}}/v1/users` with header `Authorization: Bearer {{token}}`
will send to the right host with the right token, and you can switch the whole
thing by changing the active environment.

### Request history

Every send is logged in the **History** tab in the sidebar — method, URL,
status code, response time, and a 256-character preview of the body. The last
200 entries are kept and persisted to disk. Hit **Clear** to wipe the log.

### Body modes

In the request's **Body** tab pick a mode:

- **Raw** — what you'd expect; pair with a `Content-Type` header for JSON / XML / etc.
- **x-www-form-urlencoded** — table of key/value fields, encoded as `key=val&...`.
- **form-data** — same shape but sent as `multipart/form-data` (text fields only for now).
- **GraphQL** — Query + Variables (JSON) editors. Sent as `{ "query": ..., "variables": ... }` with `application/json`.

### Searching

Type in the **🔎 Search** box in the sidebar. It filters by request name, URL, HTTP method, and folder name in real time. Collections auto-expand while searching. Click **✕** to clear.

### Keyboard shortcuts & gestures

- **⌘/Ctrl + Enter** → Send the current request (from anywhere)
- **Enter** (in URL field) → Send request
- **⌘/Ctrl + N** → New request tab
- **⌘/Ctrl + W** → Close active tab (skips pinned; prompts to save on unsaved drafts)
- **⌘/Ctrl + D** → Duplicate active tab
- **⌘/Ctrl + K** → Focus the sidebar search
- **⌘/Ctrl + P** → Command palette (fuzzy request finder)
- **⇧⌘/Ctrl⇧ + P** → Actions palette (fuzzy app-action finder — type to see every available action)
- **⌘/Ctrl + S** → Save current draft to a folder
- **↑ / ↓** → Arrow-nav through every request (when no modal or text field is focused)
- **F2** → Rename the active request (VS Code / Finder convention)
- **Double-click a request** in the sidebar → Inline rename
- **Esc** during rename → Cancel; **Enter** → Save
- **Right-click a tab** → Save to folder / Duplicate / Pin / Close / Close others / Close all
- **Right-click a request** → Rename / Duplicate / Delete
- **Right-click a collection / folder** → Rename / Add subfolder / Export / Delete

## UI conventions

### HTTP method colors

The method name next to each request is rendered as colored text (no
filled pill background — matches Postman's current look):

- 🟢 **GET** — patina green (`#86AC71`)
- 🟠 **POST** — amber gold (`#F59E0B`)
- 🟧 **PUT** — deep rust (`#B7410E`)
- 🔴 **DELETE** — crimson (`#DC2626`)
- 🟤 **PATCH** — burnt sienna (`#BA7850`)
- ⚪ **HEAD / OPTIONS** — warm muted (`#7E8391`)

The primary UI accent (selected tab, Send button, focus ring) is the brand
**rust orange** `#CE422B`.

### Status code colors

- 🟢 `2xx` — green
- 🟠 `3xx` — orange
- 🔴 `4xx` / `5xx` — red

### Collection vs folder

Nested folders render with a small folder glyph; top-level collections
intentionally omit the glyph so users can tell the two apart at a
glance. Icons throughout the UI come from the embedded **Phosphor** icon
font (via `egui-phosphor`) — tintable by color, crisp at every DPI, no
PNG/SVG assets. The collapse-header chevron is a hand-painted triangle
because it animates its rotation openness as the folder expands.
